# Reddit-Scraper
This Python-Flask application uses D3.js to visualize trends on Reddit based on the term searched by the user. We allow the user to filter results based on the subreddits of their choice and also based on the duration they want to search for. We feel this tool can be extensively be used for the purposes of reseach in any field.

There is a screenshot of our visualization:-
